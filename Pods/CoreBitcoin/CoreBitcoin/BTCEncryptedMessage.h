// Encrypted message is a very compact format inspired by Bitmessage.
// Messages are encrypted with recipient's public key (Bitcoin-compatible, that is secp256k1)
// and may contain none to full recipient information (hash of their public key) depending on your application's needs.
// Also allows attaching an optional proof-of-work that is extremely fast to evaluate.
//
// Binary structure:
// 4 bytes     version prefix (also a magic number).
// 1 byte      proof-of-work difficulty target (similar to "bits" field in BTCBlockHeader). SHA512^2 of the entire encrypted message should be below target.
// 1 byte      proof-of-work nonce. When overflown, new private key should be generated and message should be re-encrypted.
// 4 bytes     timestamp to filter out replays. Helps preventing DoS even if you don't use PoW. Big-endian.
// 1 byte      recipient's address length (R bits)
// R bits      recipient's address (BTCHash160(pubkey)), from 0 to 20 bytes. Only first R bits are used.
// 1 byte      pubkey nonce length (N) // normally - 32 bytes.
// N bytes     pubkey nonce: a compressed public key used in a DH algorithm to establish a secret that is then used as a key in AES-CBC.
// 1,2,3,5,9 bytes of message length (M) as 'CompactSize' variable-length integer encoding. See BTCProtocolSerialization.
// M bytes     encrypted message
// 16 bytes    checksum: first 16 bytes of SHA256(SHA256()) of the shared secret and the decrypted message.
//             So the receiver can verify that the message was actually sent to him before even trying to parse it.
//             We do not show the checksum of the message alone as it may leak the contents (e.g. when there is a limited set of possible messages).
//             We do not add checksum of the entire message as it's a job of a transport layer.
//             Also, a reasonably difficult proof-of-work implicitly acts as a checksum of the entire message.
